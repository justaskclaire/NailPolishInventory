### Implementation Guides
- **[guides/](guides/)** - Implementation guides for in-progress tickets

  - Completed implementations are documented directly in code comments and commit history

## 📁 Organization Policy

Implementation guides are temporary working documents:
- Created when starting complex tickets (3+ story points)
- Used to plan implementation approach and track progress
- Deleted once ticket is complete and merged
- Code serves as the documentation for completed work
